# Sketchpad
HTML5 based sketchpad implementation

This is a sketchpad based on HTML5 and can run on every modern browser.<br/>
Originally, it's a project for a class aiming at Flash. I modified it from ActionScript to JavaScript.

You can do these by this sketchpad:<br/>
1. Draw lines by mouse, change the thickness, smoothness and style of the brush or eraser.<br/>
2. Change the color of the brush in either RGB or HSV color space.<br/>
3. Import from or Export to local images.<br/>
4. Layered workspace allows multi-layer management and (opacity or blend-mode) adjustment.<br/>
5. 1 step undo is supported.<br/>

Further information can be found in the "Help" panel of the sketchpad. Remember to press SHIFT often to get more functions available!
